# 2019-nCoVdata

Argonne is leading and coordinating five related computational efforts aimed at improving our
understanding of the SARS-nCoV-2 virus, the associated COVID-19 disease, and accelerating
the development of treatment options including antiviral drugs and vaccines.   This
computational effort complements the experimental laboratory efforts at Argonne and elsewhere.
The overall effort includes team members from multiple laboratories (Argonne and Brookhaven)
multiple universities (University of Chicago, University of Illinois, University of Virginia,
Rutgers University and George Mason University) and private research centers (JC Venter Institute).   

As of Thursday March 5th, there were 57 researchers involved in the effort coordinating their
work online via real-time messaging, conferencing, email and file sharing.
Argonne’s ALCF has made special queues available on the ALCF machines for the research
groups to gain rapid access to needed computing and Argonne and Brookhaven have also
identified additional computing resources for the team’s use.  These activities are
combining bioinformatics analysis, simulation and machine learning and are building a
local collection of relevant datasets.  In addition, Argonne is making time on our
computers available to any research group that needs significant computing for coronavirus work.

Argonne is leading and coordinating five related computational efforts aimed at improving our
understanding of the SARS-nCoV-2 virus, the associated COVID-19 disease, and accelerating
the development of treatment options including antiviral drugs and vaccines.   This computational effort complements the experimental laboratory efforts at Argonne and elsewhere.  The overall effort includes team members from multiple laboratories (Argonne and Brookhaven) multiple universities (University of Chicago, University of Illinois, University of Virginia, Rutgers University and George Mason University) and private research centers (JC Venter Institute).

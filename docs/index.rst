Argonne Data Repository
============================================

This repository is for sharing data used and/or produced by the project. Larger files are `located on the Petrel data store <https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=a386b552-6086-11ea-9688-0e56c063f437&origin_path=%2F>`_, from where they can be retrieved via Globus. Other files are located on Box, but only to those with Argonne credentials. 

We also provide here a list of individual datasets, each with a link:

* ZINC smile strings for around XXX compounds (retrieved from `ZINC <http://zinc.docking.org/>`_, 
accessible `on Petrel <https://2019-ncov.e.globus.org/databases/ZINC/index.html>`_

* More to come

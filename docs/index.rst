This site is based on the X-ray Tomography Data Bank or TomoBank, provides a repository of experimental 
and simulated data sets with the aim to foster collaboration among computational scientists, 
beamline scientists and experimentalists, to accelerate the development of tomographic 
reconstruction and 3D visualization methods and to speed up their implementation in the various 
synchrotron facility data analysis software packages.

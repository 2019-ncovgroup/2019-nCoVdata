`Argonne <https://www.anl.gov>` National Laboratory's effort is led by Prof. Rick Stevens, building on the staff experience and infrastructure
developed over many years by the long-standing federal investments in bioinformatics and computational
biology programs supported by DOE-ASCR, DOE-BER (e.g. KBase) and NIH-NIAID (e.g. BV-BRC Center at UC/JCVI),
the more recent efforts in Cancer supported by the DOE/NCI joint project (JDACS4C) including the

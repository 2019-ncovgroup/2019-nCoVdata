The `Argonne National Laboratory <https://www.anl.gov/>`_
effort is led by Prof. Rick Stevens, building on the staff experience and
infrastructure developed over many years by the long-standing federal
investments in bioinformatics and computational biology programs supported by:

* The U.S. Department of Energy `Office of Science <https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science>`_ Advanced Scientific Computing Research (`ASCR <https://www.energy.gov/science/ascr/advanced-scientific-computing-research>`_) and Biological and Environmental Research (`BER <https://www.energy.gov/science/ber/biological-and-environmental-research>`_) (e.g., `KBase <https://kbase.us/>`_) programs,
* the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (`NIH-NIAID <https://www.niaid.nih.gov/>`_), e.g., the `BV-BRC Center <https://www.jcvi.org/media-center/new-bioinformatics-hub-uchicago-enables-next-gen-infectious-disease-research>`_ at the University of Chicago J. Craig Venter Institute (`JCVI <https://www.jcvi.org/>`_),
* the more recent efforts in Cancer supported by the DOE/NCI joint project (`JDACS4C <https://datascience.cancer.gov/collaborations/joint-design-advanced-computing>`_), including the `DOE ECP CANDLE <https://candle.cels.anl.gov/>`_  project and the `DOE ALCF <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/>`_ early science program.

The `Argonne National Laboratory <http://www.anl.gov/>`_
effort is led by Prof. Rick Stevens, building on the staff experience and infrastructure
developed over many years by the long-standing federal investments in bioinformatics and computational
biology programs supported by DOE-ASCR, DOE-BER (e.g. KBase) and NIH-NIAID (e.g. BV-BRC Center at UC/JCVI),
the more recent efforts in Cancer supported by the DOE/NCI joint project (JDACS4C) including the
DOE ECP CANDLE project and the DOE ALCF early science program.


*This site is based on the X-ray Tomography Data Bank or TomoBank, provides a repository of experimental 
and simulated data sets with the aim to foster collaboration among computational scientists, 
beamline scientists and experimentalists, to accelerate the development of tomographic 
reconstruction and 3D visualization methods and to speed up their implementation in the various 
synchrotron facility data analysis software packages.*
